# A course on Path Tracing

This is a course on Path Tracing, a technique to render realistic images.
It is a shortened version of a course I taught at the University of Siegen in
2022.

This course is suitable for self-study. Its concept is to implement a path
tracer from scratch step by step along with the course chapters that explain
the concepts. [Read the slides, work through the tutorial, enjoy!](https://marlam.de/path-tracing/course/)

In particular, this course is about unidirectional Monte Carlo Path Tracing. At
the end of the course, you will have built your own path tracer with support
for loading scenes in OBJ format, textures, materials, transformations and
animations, and Monte Carlo techniques such as Russian Roulette and Multiple
Importance Sampling.

All course materials use the MIT license, with the exception of a few
third-party illustrations and images which are clearly marked in the course
slides. Most of the illustrations in PDF format can be edited or exported to
other formats using the the [IPE](https://ipe.otfried.org/) editor.

The `slides` directory contains the slides written in LaTeX/Beamer.

The `tutorial` directory contains the tutorial assignments and the supporting material.

The `src` directory contains an example step-by-step implementation of the path tracer. 
Its README file describes what each version implements.
